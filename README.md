# Containerized App Exercise
## Overview
This Flask application evaluates the healthiness of product ingredient lists by analyzing images provided by the user. Leveraging OCR technology, the app extracts text from these images, parses it into a structured ingredient list, and then assesses the health impact of these ingredients based on daily recommended limits and nutritional quality. This assessment can be performed using an external API or a custom-built internal database that cross-references ingredient data with health criteria.

## Features
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images of ingredient lists directly through the web interface.
- **OCR Processing**: The application employs OCR to convert the image text into a list of ingredients.
- **Healthiness Evaluation**: Analyzes the parsed ingredients to assess the healthiness of the product, providing insights into potential concerns.
- **Result Presentation**: Delivers a straightforward analysis report to the user, highlighting the presence of any unhealthy qualities.

## Usage
1. Run the application server with `python app.py`.
2. Navigate to the provided local URL (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`) in your web browser.
3. Use the web interface to upload an image of an ingredient list from a product label.
4. View the healthiness report generated by the app based on the uploaded image.

## Development Setup
- Install Python and Flask.
- Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies.
- Configure API keys and endpoints if using an external service for healthiness evaluation.
