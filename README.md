# Containerized App Exercise
## Overview
This application utilizes GPS hardware to pinpoint the user's location and recommends cafes within a 3-mile radius. Upon locating the device, the app retrieves café data from a predefined database or through an external API, presenting users with a selection of nearby cafes. Users can then explore these recommendations and choose a café to visit based on their preferences and proximity.

## Features
- **GPS Location Detection**: Utilizes the device's GPS hardware to determine the user's current location.
- **Café Recommendations**: Provides a list of nearby cafes within a 3-mile radius of the user's location.
- **Customizable Preferences**: Allows users to specify preferences such as café ambiance, cuisine, or amenities to tailor recommendations.
- **Interactive Map View**: Displays café locations on a map interface for visual exploration and navigation.
- **Reviews and Ratings**: Integrates reviews and ratings from users or external sources to help users make informed decisions.

## Usage
1. Launch the Geo-Café Finder application on your device.
2. Grant necessary permissions for GPS location detection.
3. Once the location is detected, view the list of recommended cafes within a 3-mile radius.
4. Explore café details, reviews, and ratings to make a choice.
5. Navigate to the selected café using the integrated map or directions feature.

## Development Setup
- Integrate GPS functionalities into the application using appropriate libraries or APIs.
